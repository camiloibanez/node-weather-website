# A Weather Reporting Website

The website is hosted by Heroku and can be found [here](https://real-time-weather-describer.herokuapp.com/).

It is built with Node.js, Express, and Handlebars. It uses data from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [WeatherStack](https://weatherstack.com/).

It will report the current weather conditions for any location.
